Click the following icon @@html:<a class="tray-icon" href="javascript:void(0)"
onclick="dark_toggle();return false;" title="Toggle night mode"><i
id="dark-reader-icon" class="fa fa-moon fa-pulse" style="color:rgb(109, 146,
190); animation-iteration-count: 5;"></i></a>@@ and this website will change
dramatically right before your eyes. Because I'm
{{{postlink(2018-09-22-myos-machines, lazy)}}} I used the excellent browser
plugin [[https://darkreader.org/][Dark Reader]] on the light theme of my website to generate the dark theme.
Using its static theme engine, I copied the CSS dark reader generates and
ordinarily injects into the page. I'm now hosting that on my server and with a
bit of JavaScript attached to the moon icon, readers can now enjoy a beautiful
dark theme without having to install a plugin.

*Toggle between night / day mode from any page using the moon / sun icon in the
header from any page.*

* Generate the dark theme

  Install [[https://darkreader.org/][Dark Reader]] Browse to your website. Toggle Dark Reader on, your
  website should now be dark themed. Under the extensions [[https://darkreader.org/help/en/#more-tab][more tab]] change the
  filter to static. Press F12 to inspect your page's HTML and unfold the
  =<head>= tag. Toggle the plugin on/off look for the extension injecting a
  =<style>= tag. Expand this, copy the content and save it as [[https://github.com/admiralakber/admiralakber.github.io/blob/master/css/dark.css][dark.css]] to be
  hosted on your web server, follow the prior link to see mine. Tweak manually
  if necessary.

* Add a toggle switch

  Include the dark style sheet along side your main theme but add the =disabled=
  flag and an =id= so we have a way of finding the element.

#+BEGIN_SRC html
  <head>
    ...
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css"/>
    <link disabled id="dark-reader" rel="stylesheet" href="/css/dark.css">
    ...
  </head>
#+END_SRC

  The following JavaScript function toggles the =disabled= flag and stores the
  status so that the users choice is persistent across the website. I am using a
  slightly more complex version of this function that also sets attributes of
  the toggle icon. You can find my code current to this post [[https://github.com/admiralakber/admiralakber.github.io/blob/f765f924c61ddff3d8c14f173c3ab59c4fc23f03/js/aa-goodies.js][in this file/commit]].

  #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
    function dark_toggle() {
        var el1 = document.getElementById("dark-reader");
        if(el1.disabled) {
            el1.disabled = false;
            localStorage.setItem("darkreader", "enabled");
        } else {
            el1.disabled = true;
            localStorage.setItem("darkreader", "disabled");
        }
    }
  #+END_SRC

  Then in HTML we can create a link that on click calls the above JavaScript
  function.

  #+BEGIN_SRC html
    <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="dark_toggle();return false;" title="Toggle night mode">
      Some text, button or image that on click toggles the dark theme for this
      website. I use font awesome icons.
    </a>
  #+END_SRC

  However, as it stands even though we're storing the users theme choice we're
  not applying it on load of a page. To do this, we need to execute a bit of
  code as soon as the page loads. Add the following to somewhere near the top of
  your HTML but after including the dark theme.

  #+BEGIN_SRC web
    <script>
     if (localStorage.getItem("darkreader") == "enabled") {
         document.getElementById("dark-reader").disabled = false;
     } else {
         document.getElementById("dark-reader").disabled = true;
     }
    </script>
  #+END_SRC

  Again, my code has a bit more to it just to animate icons on click too. You
  can find my version current of this post in [[https://github.com/admiralakber/admiralakber.github.io/blob/f765f924c61ddff3d8c14f173c3ab59c4fc23f03/_includes/header.html][this file/commit]].

* Conclusions

  With nothing but simple CSS and JavaScript you can provide quite a pleasant
  experience for readers of your blog / website. There's no need for bloat or
  black box plugins into your websites CMS. By actually inspecting and what Dark
  Reader was doing to the website behind the scenes, I was able to come up with
  this simple yet effective hack.

  Please let me know how it goes for your website.
