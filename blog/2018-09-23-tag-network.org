Since I started my Ph.D about 2 years ago, I have been thinking a lot about
where knowledge is contained. This is because one of my objectives during my
Ph.D is to advance human knowledge. My research sub-field in nuclear physics is
nuclear structure. The holy grail of nuclear structure research (as far as I see
it) is to represent the [[http://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~ecs103/chart/][nuclear chart]] in such a way such that nuclei with
similar quantum structure are grouped. The electronic quantum structure has been
classified in this way already, we have the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table][periodic table]] of elements. However,
nuclear structure is objectively more complicated and it's unlikely that a
simple 2-dimensional table will be an accurate representation. Thus, a large
amount of study of nuclear structure involves identifying systematic trends
between nuclei. I can add knowledge to the field of nuclear structure by
connecting nuclei by a trend / behaviour. Turns out my thoughts on this topic
align very closely with the relatively modern (2005) theory of learning called
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism][connectivism]].

* Connecting nuclear physics and blogging

  The posts on this blog are like nuclei. The ideas they contain might be
  related to others by a topic. Much like how all the nuclei mid shell are well
  described by the rotor model. I could tag all those nuclei with @@html:<span
  style="font-variant: small-caps; color: maroon;">rotor</span>@@ just like I
  @@html:<a href="/tags">tag blog posts</a>@@ with a topic. Topics may be
  connected by posts. The simplest nuclear physics analogy I can think of:
  @@html:<span style="font-variant: small-caps; color: maroon;">K
  isomer</span>@@s are connected to @@html:<span style="font-variant:
  small-caps; color: maroon;">rotor</span>@@s by nuclei in the Hafnium region.
  Now this post connects {{{taglink(blog)}}}ging to {{{taglink(physics)}}} and I
  tricked you into learning some nuclear physics.

* The knowledge contained in this blog

  I wanted a way for me to keep track of the big picture that this blog is
  presenting to the internet for self preservation and improvement. There's no
  way a tag cloud was going to be good enough for me. I want to know how topics
  are connected as that is some representation of the knowledge I have on the
  blog. I want a network of tags as nodes and posts as links, so I made it. Here
  it is:

  @@html:
  <div name="tagnet" class="svg-container" style="padding-bottom: 200px; display: inline-block!important;">
  <svg width="300" height="200" class="svg-content-responsive"></svg>
  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
  <script src="/js/tag-network.js"></script>
  </div>
  @@

I have bounded the above to a tiny box so that it's viewable on all devices but
may look a bit crowded. A more luxurious version can be found on @@html:<a
href="/tags">my tags page</a>@@ provided your screen is >600px wide. The graph
was made with JavaScript library [[https://github.com/d3/d3][D3.js]] and I generated the input data from my
blog using [[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/][Jekyll Liquid]].

Nodes are sized based on how many posts have that tag. Nodes with more
connections are forced closer together and vice versa. You can mouse over the
nodes to see the posts associated with the topic.

** Generating the data with Jekyll Liquid

   This blog is hosted [[https://github.com/admiralakber/admiralakber.github.io][GitHub]] and compiled automatically when I push to the
   repository using Jekyll. I wrote a bit of liquid that iterates over tags and
   posts and generates the input data.

   Liquid code: [[https://github.com/admiralakber/admiralakber.github.io/blob/master/js/tag-data.json][GitHub]] → Jekyll output: @@html:<a href="/js/tag-data.json">This blog</a>@@

** Generating the graph

   This is the combination of three D3.js examples by: [[https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4600693][Mike Bostock]], [[http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/5141278][d3noob]], and
   [[https://bl.ocks.org/puzzler10/2531c035e8d514f125c4d15433f79d74][Tom Roth]].

   JavaScript code: [[https://github.com/admiralakber/admiralakber.github.io/blob/master/js/tag-network.js][GitHub]]

** Embedding it in your blog

   Save the code above in a folder =/js= on your webhost and with a little bit
   of styling:

   #+BEGIN_SRC css
     /* d3 graph / network */
     .node {
         stroke: #000;
         stroke-width: 1px;
     }

     .link {
         fill: none;
         stroke: #000;
     }
     .svg-container {
         display: inline-block;
         position: relative;
         width: 100%;
         padding-bottom: 100%;
         vertical-align: top;
         overflow: hidden;
     }
     svg.svg-content-responsive {
         display: inline-block;
         margin: auto;
         position: absolute;
         left: 0;
     }
   #+END_SRC

   And a little HTML:

   #+BEGIN_SRC html
     <div name="tagnet" class="svg-container" style="padding-bottom: 50%; /* Aspect ratio */">
       <svg width="600" height="300" class="svg-content-responsive"></svg>
       <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
       <script src="/js/tag-network.js"></script>
     </div>
   #+END_SRC

   You can embed the tag network anywhere on your Jekyll blog.

* Conclusions

  I have been thinking about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism][connectivism]] as a means of representing knowledge,
  and encoding information. I have implemented a tag network for this blog to
  test this idea. The @@html:<a href="/tags">tag network</a>@@ represents the
  topic connectivity of this blog. At a glance you can see what topics are
  covered by this blog, how much information about that topic exists, and how to
  extend your learning to other topics using this blog.

  As the author of this blog I can use the emergence of clusters in the tag
  network as an indicator of concepts that I am covering strongly. I can also
  use it as a tool to make me cognisant of the knowledge I contain and publish
  publicly. Unlike in nuclear physics where the universe defines the connections
  between nuclei, I have control over myself and can use the tag network for
  self improvement.

  I am impressed by how information rich the tag network is and have intentions
  of applying it in my research of nuclear physics.
