If you took the title to its extremity it's impossible to live in this day of
age not having delegated some work to a machine. Take for example the delivery
of this document, it's highly unlikely a human is dictating it to you purely
from memory. When I was writing about {{{postlink(2018-09-20-myos-email,my email
setup)}}} it started a train of thought that I wanted to formalise into
{{{taglink(myos)}}}. I'm interested in creating small machines that assist in
completing a task. I want to reduce the amount of energy I expend on tasks i.e.
I want to work less!

#+INCLUDE: "../myos.org::#definition-work" :only-contents t

I am however what some may call a /workaholic/, following the above definition I
can tell you that's absolutely not right. *I'm a /taskaholic/*. I love seeing
the results of my work fulfilling a purpose, and I am often (but not always)
privileged enough to be able to choose tasks that fulfill a purpose that I
believe in. Completing tasks I believe in gives me joy and does wonders for my
mental state.

#+INCLUDE: "../myos.org::#definition-task" :only-contents t

#+INCLUDE: "../myos.org::#theorem-2" :only-contents t

If you don't believe in encryption, don't bother doing it. I personally do as is
reflected in policies I have derived from @@html:<a href="/myos">earlier
theorems</a>@@. There is one more stop on this train of thought.

#+INCLUDE: "../myos.org::#theorem-3" :only-contents t

#+INCLUDE: "../myos.org::#definition-machine" :only-contents t

The above is simple but powerful. I can create machines, therefore I have the
ability to increase my own capacity. To create a machine requires work. To
efficiently create machines, they should be able to complete a task as their
purpose. Completion of a task means to create a result, so the machine must be
able to produce a result.

#+INCLUDE: "../myos.org::#policy-2" :only-contents t

myOS / policy 2 ensures that I'm not wasting energy making machines for no
purpose. Machines don't have to be complicated. A simple machine is an alias or
wrapper for software. Doing this grants the flexibility of switching out
backends to the machine without having to reconfigure systems that call upon it
to complete tasks. For example, {{{postlink(2018-09-20-myos-email,Table 3 in my
last post)}}} will become:
