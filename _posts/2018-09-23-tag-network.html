Since I started my Ph.D about 2 years ago, I have been thinking a lot about
where knowledge is contained. This is because one of my objectives during my
Ph.D is to advance human knowledge. My research sub-field in nuclear physics is
nuclear structure. The holy grail of nuclear structure research (as far as I see
it) is to represent the <a href="http://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~ecs103/chart/">nuclear chart</a> in such a way such that nuclei with
similar quantum structure are grouped. The electronic quantum structure has been
classified in this way already, we have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table">periodic table</a> of elements. However,
nuclear structure is objectively more complicated and it's unlikely that a
simple 2-dimensional table will be an accurate representation. Thus, a large
amount of study of nuclear structure involves identifying systematic trends
between nuclei. I can add knowledge to the field of nuclear structure by
connecting nuclei by a trend / behaviour. Turns out my thoughts on this topic
align very closely with the relatively modern (2005) theory of learning called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism">connectivism</a>.

The posts on this blog are like nuclei. The ideas they contain might be
related to others by a topic. Much like how all the nuclei mid shell are well
described by the rotor model. I could tag all those nuclei with <span
  style="font-variant: small-caps; color: maroon;">rotor</span> just like I
<a href="/tags">tag blog posts</a> with a topic. Topics may be
connected by posts. The simplest nuclear physics analogy I can think of:
<span style="font-variant: small-caps; color: maroon;">K
  isomer</span>s are connected to <span style="font-variant:
  small-caps; color: maroon;">rotor</span>s by nuclei in the Hafnium region.
Now this post connects <a href="/tags#blog" style="font-variant : small-caps;">blog</a>ging to <a href="/tags#physics" style="font-variant : small-caps;">physics</a> and I
tricked you into learning some nuclear physics.

<h2 id="org3ad4dda">The knowledge contained in this blog</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3ad4dda">
<p>
I wanted a way for me to keep track of the big picture that this blog is
presenting to the internet for self preservation and improvement. There's no
way a tag cloud was going to be good enough for me. I want to know how topics
are connected as that is some representation of the knowledge I have on the
blog. I want a network of tags as nodes and posts as links, so I made it. Here
it is:
</p>

<p>

  <div name="tagnet" class="svg-container" style="display: inline-block!important;">
  <svg width="300" height="200" class="svg-content-responsive"></svg>
  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
  <script src="/js/tag-network.js"></script>
  </div>

</p>

<p>
I have bounded the above to a tiny box so that it's viewable on all devices but
may look a bit crowded. A more luxurious version can be found on <a
href="/tags">my tags page</a> provided your screen is &gt;600px wide. The graph
was made with JavaScript library <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3">D3.js</a> and I generated the input data from my
blog using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/">Jekyll Liquid</a>.
</p>

<p>
Nodes are sized based on how many posts have that tag. Nodes with more
connections are forced closer together. You can mouse over the nodes to see the
posts associated with the topic.

This blog is hosted <a href="https://github.com/admiralakber/admiralakber.github.io">GitHub</a> and compiled automatically when I push to the
repository using Jekyll. I wrote a bit of liquid that iterates over tags and
posts and generates the input data.

Save the code above in a folder <code>/js</code> on your webhost and with a little bit
of styling:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-css"><span style="color: #01a0e4;">.node </span><span style="color: #a16a94;">{</span>
    <span style="color: #a16a94;">stroke</span>: <span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #000;">#000</span>;
    <span style="color: #a16a94;">stroke-width</span>: <span style="color: #e8bbd0;">1px</span>;
<span style="color: #a16a94;">}</span>

<span style="color: #01a0e4;">.link </span><span style="color: #a16a94;">{</span>
    <span style="color: #a16a94;">fill</span>: none;
    <span style="color: #a16a94;">stroke</span>: <span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #000;">#000</span>;
<span style="color: #a16a94;">}</span>
<span style="color: #01a0e4;">.svg-container </span><span style="color: #a16a94;">{</span>
    <span style="color: #a16a94;">display</span>: inline-block;

<span style="color: #a16a94;">}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And a little HTML:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-html">&lt;<span style="color: #01a0e4;">div</span> <span style="color: #db2d20;">name</span>=<span style="color: #01a252;">"tagnet"</span> <span style="color: #db2d20;">class</span>=<span style="color: #01a252;">"svg-container"</span>&gt;

  &lt;<span style="color: #01a0e4;">script</span> <span style="color: #db2d20;">src</span>=<span style="color: #01a252;">"https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color: #01a0e4;">script</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span style="color: #01a0e4;">script</span> <span style="color: #db2d20;">src</span>=<span style="color: #01a252;">"/js/tag-network.js"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color: #01a0e4;">script</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color: #01a0e4;">div</span>&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can embed the tag network anywhere on your Jekyll blog.

<p>
I have been thinking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism">connectivism</a> as a means of representing knowledge,
and encoding information. I have implemented a tag network for this blog to
test this idea. The <a href="/tags">tag network</a> represents the
topic connectivity of this blog. At a glance you can see what topics are
covered by this blog, how much information about that topic exists, and how to
extend your learning to other topics using this blog.
</p>

<p>
As the author of this blog I can use the emergence of clusters in the tag
network as an indicator of concepts that I am covering strongly. I can also
use it as a tool to make me cognisant of the knowledge I contain and publish
publicly. Unlike in nuclear physics where the universe defines the connections
between nuclei, I have control over myself and can use the tag network for
self improvement.
</p>

<p>
I am impressed by how information rich the tag network is and have intentions
of applying it in my research of nuclear physics.
