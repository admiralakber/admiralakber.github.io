Dear and beautiful readers, I warmly invite you to share in the best
selection of my thoughts and experiences here at my new blog,
*welcome*.

My last and now depreciated blog, *The evasive action* was my first
attempt at blogging. While I had no topical restriction on its
content, it was dominated by my adventures with GNU/Linux and
computing. The posts were educational as well as descriptive and the
response from readers was overwhelmingly positive. Having entered a
new phase of my life, I now have more to write about.

I have started my Ph.D at the Australian National University earlier
this year. I am no longer in a mad scurry to become a researcher; I am
now in a scurry to do research. In addition, my teaching and
demonstrating responsibilities have increased; it is likely that
future blog posts will reflect this. With that said, many things I
enjoy doing in my spare time is me exploring other avenues of my
skills - or developing new ones - that I use in my research. Referring

below, expect the most interesting and, behind the scenes of the 90%
on the left, and the 10% on the right.

Because the skills required to research physics is quite broad, I
envision a potential navigational problem. To circumvent this fact, I
have implemented [tags]({{site.base_url}}/tags) to organize the
posts. You will see them throughout this website and in the
[Atom/RSS+XML feed]({{site.base_url}}/feed.xml). Finally, I encourage
public communication and engagement be it via
[twitter](https://twitter.com/AdmiralAkber) or the comments below. I
hope you enjoy your stay.
