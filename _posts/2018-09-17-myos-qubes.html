Here's the back story: the last year has been non-stop work. My <code>$HOME</code> folder
turned has about 100 files just sitting in it, 2 <code>tmp</code> folders filled with lots
of stuff, I'm constantly synchronising emails to my disk so that I can use
<a href="https://notmuchmail.org/">notmuch</a> mail to filter it but something broke &#x2013; I don't even remember / know
what (maybe nothing?), I have accrued many private keys for all the VPS' I've
been using, invested in a <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">password manager</a> and am only starting to realise how
easy it is to get to 50+ different services &#x2013; and none of this is backed up.
</p>

<p>
My entire digital existence, ability to operate at my desired pace, and
thousands of hours of work over the past year exists solely my laptop. I rely on
all of the digital systems patchily held together on my laptop like oxygen. It
is the ever reliable tool that is now broken, awaiting to be picked up by
courier today to be sent back to Lenovo. I'm somewhat lucky, that my old laptop
started to fail at this time when I seem to be perpetually struck down my
viruses and therefore have an excuse to "take a break" and backup all my data at
the very least. Of course being me, I'd rather take this an opportunity to
review, revise, and do better. I'm forcing a <i>complete systems reboot</i> on my
terms.
</p>

<p>
This time, I have a recovery plan that starts from pen and paper. Starting from
my notebook you should be able to reconstruct my operating system to all systems
go even if I had completely lost my memory or died. I broadened what I consider
<i>my</i> operating system to include hardware devices both <i>analogue</i> and <code>digital</code>.
This has allowed me to include more aspects of my life as <i>systems</i>. My
operating system is the collection of these systems carefully designed such that
I achieve my goals transparently. Something I want to stress &#x2013; nothing should
feel like it gets in the way. I just do within my operating system and things
happen the way I want them. This lets me, the human, do what I do best: focus on
the creative and abstract.
</p>

<p>
Yeah&#x2026; it was only a matter of time before I was to become a full blown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_hack">life
hacker</a>.
</p>

<p>
As my laptop only died about 4 weeks ago and I am being painfully conscientious
about all design decisions I have decided to start publishing this little
endeavor of mine in pieces under the <a href="/tags#myos"
style="font-variant : small-caps;">myos</a> tag. Since I am down a laptop,
before I can start on the fun <i>analogue</i> stuff I better replace my laptop.
</p>

<p>
Jumping right to it.

<p>
My laptop on the way out is a Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga X1 Carbon Gen 2 (x1y2) with
a gorgeous WQHD OLED screen. I bought the x1y2 for the screen: black meant
zero light, fantastic for power consumption and night use. Being a Thinkpad X1
it's rugged and lightweight too &#x2013; necessary features because it is important
to me that I can simply slip my laptop in my <i>analogue</i>::device::bag and head
off to work anywhere.
</p>

<p>
Lenovo offered to replace my x1y2 with an x1y3 (gen 3) while the processor is
faster and it was a fair trade monetarily it didn't have an OLED screen and
therefore for me was not a value trade. Instead, I got a cash refund and
purchased a Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 6 (x1g6). It also doesn't have an OLED
screen but it is smaller, lighter, and I was able to get an even faster
processor and more <code>digital</code>::storage::local::bulk to offset the loss of the
screen.

<p>
After being a loyal <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> user for over 5 years I have decided to move
to <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes OS</a>. I hadn't tried Qubes before and it started off simply out of
curiosity but I believe I'm going to stick with it. Qubes provides security
by design through compartmentalisation. Security is important to me and using
Qubes (correctly) forces me to <b>be more secure simply by operating within
it</b>. However, this isn't the only reason why I have selected Qubes.
Compartmentalising is organising too, proof of which I leave as an exercise
to the reader.
</p>

<p>
For my current mode of operation, I find that there are only two drawbacks to
the compartmentalisation that Qubes provides: no GPU rendering in the
browser, and audio forwarding takes more CPU. I understand and completely
respect that this is for security reasons. I also greatly respect the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/team/">Qubes
team's</a> dedication to security <i>and user experience</i>. It's only a matter of
time before something is worked out and it will be awesome. Qubes is the
future.

<h2 id="org59be037">Organisation by compartmentalisation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org59be037">
<p>
As I was looking at the top level of my old documents folder I had separated
it into: personal, university, businessX. As you can see from <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0x14FC5B7CFED383A3">PGP Identity</a> I
also have multiple email accounts, each one calls on me to do a different type
of work. Unsurprisingly, these email accounts directly translate to my now old
top level folders of files. It makes sense from a security standpoint, and an
organisation standpoint to have a different qube for each of these email
accounts. The emergence of this organisation organically makes sense: when you
start a new role at a company, one of the first things they do for you is set
up an email account. This brings me to my first theorem:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-keypoint">myOS / theorem 1
An email account provides an interface for the outside world for you to send and receive tasks and work.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So for every role/hat/character I play in the world I have an email account
for input+output. To ensure it's actually getting to Aqeel the human, it must
be associated with my <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0x14FC5B7CFED383A3">PGP Identity</a>. I'm liking this character-human relation
so let's go with that for my first policy:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-keypoint">myOS / policy 1
For each character of the human Aqeel Akber there is:
  - an email account associated on PGP Identity 0x14FC5B7CFED383A3
  - a qube on digital::device::laptop::distro
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<b>Please don't trust the above statement of my PGP Identity blindly</b>. Better,
 cross-check it with the <a href="https://github.com/admiralakber/admiralakber.github.io/blob/master/myos.org">signed PGP commit and original org file used to
 generate this page.</a>

<h2 id="orgae8286c">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgae8286c">
<p>
I am introducing myOS as a set of theorems and policies that define the my
mode of operation with all systems in my life. The conscious design choice
involved in developing of these theorems and policies is an investment of
time. Return on this investment is a freeing of decision making and reducing
stress in the future. The goal of myOS is to create an environment where
progression of my personal identity and creation of work is maximised and
effort is minimised.
</p>

<p>
Following myOS / theorem 1 and policy 1 ensures security and organisation by
compartmentalisation. <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/backup-restore">Backups have become trivial</a> and security is improved. It
fits naturally into my "character" workflow that I had noticed emerged
organically. Surprisingly, my dotfiles have become simpler too and will be the
subject of the next installment of <a href="/tags#myos"
  style="font-variant : small-caps;">myos</a>.
